// Problem Solving Steps:
// * 1. Identify - the first step is to identify and understand the nature of the problem
// * 2. Research & Refine - at this step you should have a main problem broken down into a few subproblem
// * 3. Pseudocode - focus on logic, NOT syntax
// * 4. Test-Driven Development
// * 5. Implement - "Done is better than perfect"
// * 6. Practice - "to become really good at anything, you have to practice and repeat, practice and repeat,
// *                until the technique becomes intuitive."
// * 7. Repeate!
